#CTF Tools

Since I lost my laptop a month back, with that I lost all the collection of my important CTF solving softwares and tools. It takes time to build up the collection. So I am adding them all here, just in case.

_If you know a tool that isn't present here, feel free to open a pull request._

In case of tools/repos with huge code, I will add tool title and description to readme only.
